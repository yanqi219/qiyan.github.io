2018-10-1	Air pollution and Autism in Denmark	Environ Epidemiol	"With Danish registers, we conducted a nationwide case–control study of 15,387 children with ASD born 1989–2013 and 68,139 population controls matched by birth year and sex identified from the birth registry. We generated air dispersion geographic information system (AirGIS) model estimates for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and particulate matter 10 (PM10) at mothers’ home from 9 months before to 9 months after pregnancy and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for parental age, neighborhood socioeconomic indicators, and maternal smoking using conditional logistic regression. Our data suggest that air pollutant exposure in early infancy but not during pregnancy increases the risk of being diagnosed with autism and Asperger among children born in Denmark."

2019-10-01	Maternal serum metabolome and traffic-related air pollution exposure in pregnancy	Environment international	We conducted high-resolution metabolomics to detect metabolic signals associated with air pollution in maternal mid-pregnancy serum. The metabolomic features and pathways we found to be associated with air pollution exposure suggest that maternal exposure during pregnancy induces oxidative stress and inflammation pathways previously implicated in pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes.

We identified microbiota abundance differences in human colostrums. The microbial diversity showed a tendency to decrease with increasing HCH levels. Pseudomonas was varied with different γ-HCH exposure levels.

2020-1-1	The Association of Physical Activity with Cardiovascular Events and Mortality Mediated by Diabetes in Older Mexican Americans	American Journal of Epidemiology	We aimed to elucidate the extent to which diabetes mediates the effect of nonoccupational PA levels on CVD and mortality among older Mexican Americans. Our findings indicate that public health interventions targeting diabetes prevention and management would be a worthwhile strategy for preventing CVD and mortality among older Mexican Americans with insufficient PA levels.

2020-2-1	Untargeted Metabolomics Screen of Mid‐pregnancy Maternal Serum and Autism in Offspring	Autism Research	"This study found that in mid-pregnancy the blood of mothers who give birth to a child that develops autism has some characteristic features that are different from those of blood samples taken from control mothers. These features are related to biologic mechanisms that can affect fetal brain development. In the future, these insights may help identify biomarkers for early autism diagnosis and treatment or preventive measures."

2020-3-1	An epigenome-wide association study of ambient pyrethroid pesticide exposures in California's central valley	International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health	"We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of pyrethroid pesticides. Several CpG sites were differentially associated with pyrethroid pesticide exposure. We examined pathways and diseases for genes annotated to CpG sites. Biological pathways ranged from cell signaling to neurodevelopment. Implicated diseases included Alzheimer’s, leukemia, & other cancers."	"Furlong, M. A.;  Paul, K. C.;  Yan, Q.;  Chuang, Y.

2020-4-1	Air pollution and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes: Mediation analysis using metabolomic profiles	Current environmental health reports	"We reviewed how to use metabolomic profiling in causal mediation analysis to assess epidemiological evidence for air pollution impacts on birth outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation along specified pathways can be assessed within the structural causal modeling framework. For causal inferences, several assumptions that go beyond the data—including no uncontrolled confounding—need to be made to justify the effect decomposition. Nevertheless, studies that integrate metabolomic information in causal mediation analysis may greatly improve our understanding of the effects of ambient air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes as they allow us to suggest and test hypotheses about underlying biological mechanisms in studies of pregnant women."

2020-5-1	Epigenetic mutation load is weakly correlated with epigenetic age acceleration	Aging (Albany NY)	"DNA methylation (DNAm) age estimators are widely used to study aging-related conditions. It is not yet known whether DNAm age is associated with the accumulation of stochastic epigenetic mutations (SEMs), which reflect dysfunctions of the epigenetic maintenance system. Here, we defined epigenetic mutation load (EML) as the total number of SEMs per individual. We assessed associations between EML and DNAm age acceleration estimators using biweight midcorrelations in four population-based studies (total n = 6,388). EML was not only positively associated with chronological age (meta r = 0.171), but also with four measures of epigenetic age acceleration: the Horvath pan tissue clock, intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration, the Hannum clock, and the GrimAge clock (meta-analysis correlation ranging from r = 0.109 to 0.179). We further conducted pathway enrichment analyses for each participant’s SEMs. The enrichment result demonstrated the stochasticity of epigenetic mutations, meanwhile implicated several pathways: signaling, neurogenesis, neurotransmitter, glucocorticoid, and circadian rhythm pathways may contribute to faster DNAm age acceleration. Finally, investigating genomic-region specific EML, we found that EMLs located within regions of transcriptional repression (TSS1500, TSS200, and 1stExon) were associated with faster age acceleration. Overall, our findings suggest a role for the accumulation of epigenetic mutations in the aging process."	"Yan, Q.;  Paul, K. C.;  Lu, A. T.;  Kusters, C.;  Binder, A.

2021-2-1	"High-Resolution Metabolomic Assessment of Pesticide Exposure in Central Valley, California"	Chemical Research in Toxicology	"Pesticides are widely used in the agricultural Central Valley region of California. Historically, this has included organophosphates (OPs), organochlorines (OCs), and pyrethroids (PYRs). This study aimed to identify perturbations of the serum metabolome in response to each class of pesticide and mutual associations between groups of metabolites and multiple pesticides. We conducted high-resolution metabolomic profiling of serum samples from 176 older adults living in the California Central Valley using liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. We estimated chronic pesticide exposure (from 1974 to year of blood draw) to OPs, OCs, and PYRs from ambient sources at homes and workplaces with a geographic information system (GIS)-based model. Based on partial least-squares regression and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with one or multiple pesticide classes, including mitochondrial energy metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Utilizing an integrative network approach, we found that the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway is a common pathway shared across all three pesticide classes. The disruptions of the serum metabolome suggested that chronic pesticide exposure might result in oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which have been previously implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Overall, our findings provided a comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms of chronic pesticide toxicity, and, for the first time, our approach informs exposome research by moving from macrolevel population exposures to microlevel biologic responses."

2020-6-1	Maternal prenatal smoking and autism spectrum disorder in offspring: a California statewide cohort and sibling study	American Journal of Epidemiology	"We examined associations between maternal smoking and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children in a statewide population-based cohort and sibling-comparison design using California birth records (n = 2,015,104) with information on maternal smoking, demographic factors, and pregnancy (2007–2010). Our findings are consistent with an increased risk for ASD in offspring of mothers who smoked ≥20 cigarettes/day during pregnancy; associations with lighter smoking were weaker."	"von Ehrenstein, O.

2021-1-1	Metabolomics analysis of maternal serum exposed to high air pollution during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder in offspring	Environmental Research	We detected metabolic features in maternal pregnancy serum associated with offspring ASD in high air pollution exposed women. Metabolomic pathways link high levels of traffic-related air pollution in early pregnancy to ASD. Metabolic pathway perturbation related to mitochondrial dysfunction may affect the development of ASD.	"Kim, J. H.;  Yan, Q.;  Uppal, K.;  Cui, X.;  Ling, C.;  Walker, D. I.;  Heck, J.
