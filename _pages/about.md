Hi! Iâ€™m Qi, an postdoctoral research scientist in the [Baccarelli Lab](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/laboratory-precision-environmental-health) at Columbia University. My research focuses on environmental health and aging. I am particularly interested in employing multi-omics analytical approaches to identify the role of environmental exposures on the aging process.

I received my Ph.D in epidemiology from the [UCLA](https://ph.ucla.edu/) under the mentorship of Dr. Beate Ritz, and my B.A. in life sciences at the [Peking University](http://www.bio.pku.edu.cn/enhomes/index/). My past research has focused on utilizing multi-omics techniques, including exposomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics, to investigate the interplay between environmental exposures and various adverse health outcomes.
