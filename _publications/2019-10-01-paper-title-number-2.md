excerpt: 'We conducted high-resolution metabolomics to detect metabolic signals associated with air pollution in maternal mid-pregnancy serum. The metabolomic features and pathways we found to be associated with air pollution exposure suggest that maternal exposure during pregnancy induces oxidative stress and inflammation pathways previously implicated in pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes.'

We conducted high-resolution metabolomics to detect metabolic signals associated with air pollution in maternal mid-pregnancy serum. The metabolomic features and pathways we found to be associated with air pollution exposure suggest that maternal exposure during pregnancy induces oxidative stress and inflammation pathways previously implicated in pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes.
