excerpt: 'We detected metabolic features in maternal pregnancy serum associated with offspring ASD in high air pollution exposed women. Metabolomic pathways link high levels of traffic-related air pollution in early pregnancy to ASD. Metabolic pathway perturbation related to mitochondrial dysfunction may affect the development of ASD.'

We detected metabolic features in maternal pregnancy serum associated with offspring ASD in high air pollution exposed women. Metabolomic pathways link high levels of traffic-related air pollution in early pregnancy to ASD. Metabolic pathway perturbation related to mitochondrial dysfunction may affect the development of ASD.
