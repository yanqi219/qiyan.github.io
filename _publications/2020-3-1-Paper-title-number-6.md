title: "An epigenome-wide association study of ambient pyrethroid pesticide exposures in California's central valley"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-3-1-Paper-title-number-6
excerpt: 'We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of pyrethroid pesticides. Several CpG sites were differentially associated with pyrethroid pesticide exposure. We examined pathways and diseases for genes annotated to CpG sites. Biological pathways ranged from cell signaling to neurodevelopment. Implicated diseases included Alzheimer’s, leukemia, &amp; other cancers.'

We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of pyrethroid pesticides. Several CpG sites were differentially associated with pyrethroid pesticide exposure. We examined pathways and diseases for genes annotated to CpG sites. Biological pathways ranged from cell signaling to neurodevelopment. Implicated diseases included Alzheimer’s, leukemia, &amp; other cancers.
