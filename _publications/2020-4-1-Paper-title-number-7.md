title: "Air pollution and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes: Mediation analysis using metabolomic profiles"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-4-1-Paper-title-number-7
excerpt: 'We reviewed how to use metabolomic profiling in causal mediation analysis to assess epidemiological evidence for air pollution impacts on birth outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation along specified pathways can be assessed within the structural causal modeling framework. For causal inferences, several assumptions that go beyond the data—including no uncontrolled confounding—need to be made to justify the effect decomposition. Nevertheless, studies that integrate metabolomic information in causal mediation analysis may greatly improve our understanding of the effects of ambient air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes as they allow us to suggest and test hypotheses about underlying biological mechanisms in studies of pregnant women.'

We reviewed how to use metabolomic profiling in causal mediation analysis to assess epidemiological evidence for air pollution impacts on birth outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation along specified pathways can be assessed within the structural causal modeling framework. For causal inferences, several assumptions that go beyond the data—including no uncontrolled confounding—need to be made to justify the effect decomposition. Nevertheless, studies that integrate metabolomic information in causal mediation analysis may greatly improve our understanding of the effects of ambient air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes as they allow us to suggest and test hypotheses about underlying biological mechanisms in studies of pregnant women.
