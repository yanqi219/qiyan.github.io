excerpt: 'With Danish registers, we conducted a nationwide case–control study of 15,387 children with ASD born 1989–2013 and 68,139 population controls matched by birth year and sex identified from the birth registry. We generated air dispersion geographic information system (AirGIS) model estimates for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and particulate matter 10 (PM10) at mothers’ home from 9 months before to 9 months after pregnancy and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for parental age, neighborhood socioeconomic indicators, and maternal smoking using conditional logistic regression. Our data suggest that air pollutant exposure in early infancy but not during pregnancy increases the risk of being diagnosed with autism and Asperger among children born in Denmark.'

With Danish registers, we conducted a nationwide case–control study of 15,387 children with ASD born 1989–2013 and 68,139 population controls matched by birth year and sex identified from the birth registry. We generated air dispersion geographic information system (AirGIS) model estimates for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and particulate matter 10 (PM10) at mothers’ home from 9 months before to 9 months after pregnancy and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for parental age, neighborhood socioeconomic indicators, and maternal smoking using conditional logistic regression. Our data suggest that air pollutant exposure in early infancy but not during pregnancy increases the risk of being diagnosed with autism and Asperger among children born in Denmark.
