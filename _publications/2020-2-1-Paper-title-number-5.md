excerpt: 'This study found that in mid-pregnancy the blood of mothers who give birth to a child that develops autism has some characteristic features that are different from those of blood samples taken from control mothers. These features are related to biologic mechanisms that can affect fetal brain development. In the future, these insights may help identify biomarkers for early autism diagnosis and treatment or preventive measures.'

This study found that in mid-pregnancy the blood of mothers who give birth to a child that develops autism has some characteristic features that are different from those of blood samples taken from control mothers. These features are related to biologic mechanisms that can affect fetal brain development. In the future, these insights may help identify biomarkers for early autism diagnosis and treatment or preventive measures.
