excerpt: 'We aimed to elucidate the extent to which diabetes mediates the effect of nonoccupational PA levels on CVD and mortality among older Mexican Americans. Our findings indicate that public health interventions targeting diabetes prevention and management would be a worthwhile strategy for preventing CVD and mortality among older Mexican Americans with insufficient PA levels.'

We aimed to elucidate the extent to which diabetes mediates the effect of nonoccupational PA levels on CVD and mortality among older Mexican Americans. Our findings indicate that public health interventions targeting diabetes prevention and management would be a worthwhile strategy for preventing CVD and mortality among older Mexican Americans with insufficient PA levels.
